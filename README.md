Bosch in angularjs

If you dont want to setup localhost to run this html go for A

(A): Open the index.html

If you want to see the directive templating in action angularjs open B

(B): Open the index-with-directive.html


Note : You need to setup live server to run the index-with-directive.html otherwise headerui directive wont work.

2. I have used html,css,angularjs and jquery in this.

3. All the assets are inside the assets folder.
